# Getting To Blinky

In this project, I design a flashing LED circuit using a 555 timer. The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with simple PCB design. The inspiration for this project comes from [GETTING TO BLINKY 4.0](https://contextualelectronics.com/courses/getting-to-blinky/)

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repo or download the .zip file.

### Prerequisites

To open any of the PCB design files, you will need Kicad.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Installing Kicad

```
Kicad is free and open source and may be downloaded from http://kicad-pcb.org/
```
